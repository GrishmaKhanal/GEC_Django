## Getting Started
If you just want to check our project just goto [Report and Conclusion](#report-and-conclusion)

In this project you need:
pip
pipenv
    
  Install pip
   open the terminal and make sure you have python3 installed
   
   verify the pip installation using:
   ```
   pip --version
   ```

  Install pipenv

   ```
   pip install pipenv
   ```

## Installation
   To install the required items for the project:

   For machine wide installation
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
    
   Create a new virtual environment using 'pipenv':
   ```
   pipenv shell
   ```

   Install the required packages from 'requirements.txt'
   ```
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Run server
   To run the django server:
   Make sure the virtual environment is active

   ```
   pipenv shell
   ```
   Then
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   the default server is 127.0.0.1:8000
   you can change the port address by adding a 4 digit number at the end of runserver command, like
   ```
   python manage.py runserver 9000
   ```

   Now you can change the django file to your liking. Always make sure the virtual environment is activated using "pipenv shell"
